# Congestion-Control-in-WSN-using-DAlPaS
This is a simulation of the graph for average number of hops v/s average number of nodes using DAlPaS method for conjesion control in WSNs

<h2>Steps to run the simulation</h2>
1) Run the c++ program cn_Implementation.cpp<br>
g++ cn_Implementation.cpp<br>
./a.out<br>
2) Once that is run all the simulation result gets stored in statistics.txt<br>
3) To get a graphical view of this data, run the python file plotGraph.py<br>
python3 plotGraph.py
